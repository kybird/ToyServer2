# 2025-12-10 Development Log

## Summary
Focus was on stabilizing the Client-Server network communication and refactoring core components.

## Key Changes

### 1. DummyClient Receive Fixes
- **Issue**: Client reported 0 received packets during stress testing.
- **Root Cause**:
    - Send rate was unthrottled, overwhelming the processing loop.
    - `RecvBuffer` state was not reset when `AsioSession` was reused from the pool (Zombie Session).
- **Fixes**:
    - Implemented send throttling in `DummyClient`.
    - Added `RecvBuffer` reset logic in `AsioSession::Reset`.

### 2. Network Refactoring
- **Separation of Concerns**: Split `Reader` and `Writer` classes.
    - Moved from header-only/inline implementation to separate `.h` and `.cpp` files in `src/System/Network/ASIO/Components`.
    - Improved compilation time and code organization.

## Results
- Verified reliable Echo packet transmission in Release mode under load.
